This repo will cover the basic information for using Git and GitHub.

General Knowledge
=================

What is ``Git``?
----------------
* A distributed :term:`version control system` which tracks changes in source code.
* A command line to (which can be downloaded via Anaconda, PYPI, etc.) that is installed on your local system.
* A tool that manages different versions of edits, made to files in a :term:`repository`.

What is ``GitHub``?
-------------------
* A web-based service for Git repositories.
* A graphical user interface for users to upload, download, and edits files via web.
* It provides a platform for collaborative effort to bring teams together.

But we use a shared folder...
-----------------------------
Using a shared folder may be convenient as most users will know how to interact with Windows Explorer or some other system.
However, having access to a shared folder can lead to many issues...

    **Lost Documents**: sometimes files accidentally get deleted or removed, which can lead to copying files creating duplicates.
    
    **Duplicates**: copies of files being made with different versions.

    **Security**: files can be easily manipulated if proper access is not in place. Also it is more difficult to track who access/edited a file.

    **Searching**: without proper structure, it can be extremely difficult finding files and their :term:`metadata`.

How does Github solve this?
---------------------------

    **Documents are never lost**: thanks to GitHub's :term:`version control system`, if a file is accidentally removed or deleted, you can trace the history and retrieve the file.

    **No duplicates**: GitHub will give you a error message if you try to load a file of the same name.
    
    **Secure**: with GitHub has features such as a :term:`protected branch`, :term:`read access` and :term:`security log`. This can prevent unwanted access to files. You can also create a :term:`private repository`.
    
    **Index Searching**: in GitHub, you can search keywords or files in an entire :term:`repository` or all of GitHub public repositories.

Now that we covered why should we use GitHub, let's look into some features GitHub offers.
