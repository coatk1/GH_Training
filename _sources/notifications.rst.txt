Notifications
=============

Notifications provide updates about the activity on GitHub that you've subscribed to. You can use the notifications inbox to customize, triage, and manage your updates.

Default subscriptions
=====================
In general, you are automatically subscribed to conversations by default when you have:

* Not disabled automatic watching for repositories or teams you've joined in your notification settings. This setting is enabled by default.
* Been assigned to an issue or pull request.
* Opened a pull request, issue, or created a team discussion post.
* Commented on a thread.
* Subscribed to a thread manually by clicking **Watch** or **Subscribe**.
* Had your username @mentioned.
* Changed the state of a thread, such as by closing an issue or merging a pull request.
* Had a team you're a member of @mentioned.

By default, you also automatically watch all repositories that you create and are owned by your user account.

Watch settings
==============
You can choose whether to watch or unwatch an individual repository. You can also choose to only be notified of new releases or ignore an individual repository.

On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

In the upper-right corner, click the "Watch" drop-down menu to select a watch option.

Unwatch a repository
====================
When you unwatch a repository, you unsubscribe from future updates from that repository unless you participate in a conversation or are @mentioned.

In the upper-right corner of any page, click the bell.

In the left sidebar, under the list of repositories, use the "Manage notifications" drop-down to click **Watched repositories**.

On the watched repositories page, after you've evaluated the repositories you're watching, choose whether to:

* unwatch a repository
* only watch releases for a repository
* ignore all notifications for a repository
