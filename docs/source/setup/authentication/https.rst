Cloning with HTTPS URLs
=======================
The https:// clone URLs are available on all repositories, public and private. These URLs work even if you are behind a firewall or proxy.

When you ``git clone``, ``git fetch``, ``git pull``, or ``git push`` to a remote repository using HTTPS URLs on the command line, Git will ask for your GitHub username and password. For enhanced security, we recommend using a personal access token (PAT) instead of a password. Treat your PAT just like a password and enter your PAT when prompted for a password.
