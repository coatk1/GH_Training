Project Boards
==============

:term:`Project board` on GitHub help you organize and prioritize your work. 
You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. 
With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs.

Project boards are made up of :term:`issue`, :term:`pull request`, and notes that are categorized as cards in columns of your choosing. You can drag and drop or use keyboard shortcuts to reorder cards within a column, move cards from column to column, and change the order of columns.

Project board cards contain relevant metadata for issues and pull requests, like :term:`label`, assignees, the status, and who opened it. 
You can view and make lightweight edits to issues and pull requests within your project board by clicking on the issue or pull request's title.

You can create notes within columns to serve as task reminders, references to issues and pull requests from any repository on GitHub, or to add information related to the project board. 
You can create a reference card for another project board by adding a link to a note. If the note isn't sufficient for your needs, you can convert it to an issue.

Types of project boards:

* User-owned project boards can contain issues and pull requests from any personal repository.
* Organization-wide project boards can contain issues and pull requests from any repository that belongs to an organization.
* Repository project boards are scoped to issues and pull requests within a single repository.

Templates
=========
You can use templates to quickly set up a new project board. 
When you use a template to create a project board, your new board will include columns as well as cards with tips for using project boards. 
You can also choose a template with automation already configured.

* Basic kanban: Track your tasks with To do, In progress, and Done columns
* Automated kanban: Cards automatically move between To do, In progress, and Done columns
* Automated kanban with review: Cards automatically move between To do, In progress, and Done columns, with additional triggers for pull request review status
* Bug triage: Triage and prioritize bugs with To do, High priority, Low priority, and Closed columns
